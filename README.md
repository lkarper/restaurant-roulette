# Restaurant Roulette
Are you hungry, but can't decide where to eat? Are you planning a meal with one or more companions and no one can agree on a destination?  [*Restaurant Roulette*](https://lkarper.github.io/restaurant-roulette/) is here to help!

## Summary
Restaurant Roulette was made for indecisive hungry people who know that they want to dine out but cannot decide where.  Users simply enter some basic information on where they’d like to eat, a city or zip-code, and (optionally) what sorts of restaurants they enjoy.  Users then spin the restaurant wheel to get information from Foursquare on a random restaurant that meets their needs.  While results are filtered by the needs of users, they are otherwise random.  Spin until you’re satisfied or let luck be your guide and discover new places along the way!  Once users like the looks of a restaurant, they can enter the location of a point of departure and get maps and step-by-step directions to that restaurant from MapQuest.  Whether you drive, walk, or cycle, Restaurant Roulette can help you find your new favorite restaurant!
